# Unity-DijkstraPathFinding
Pathfinding with road nodes using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Purpose
- Implement A path finding algorithm without needing to implement a grid of nodes.
- Roads placed by the player become nodes and are slowly built up over time.

### Bugs
- There is currently a bug where if the offset between the tiles is too great, the neighbours of the nodes cannot be found.
